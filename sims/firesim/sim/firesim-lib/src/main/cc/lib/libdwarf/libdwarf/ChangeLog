      * dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_dnames.c, dwarf_dsc.c,
        dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_frame.c,dwarf_frame2.c,
        dwarf_gdbindex.c,dwarf_generic_init.c,dwarf_init_finish.c,
        dwarf_line.c,dwarf_loc.c,dwarf_loc2.h,dwarf_machoread.c,

        dwarf_tsearchhash.c,dwarf_util.c,dwarf_xu_index.c,pro_alloc.c,
        pro_arange.c,pro_expr.c,pro_line.c,pro_macinfo.c,
        pro_section.c,pro_types.c: Fixed 56 bugs found
        by llvm's scan-build tool.
2019-01-27   David Anderson
      * dwarf_form.c,dwarf_gdbindex.c,dwarf_object_read_common.c,
        pro_forms.c,pro_section.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
2019-01-27   David Anderson
      * dwarf_object_read_common.c,dwarf_object_read_common.h:
        Now uses the ISO (1990) datatypes off_t and size_t and
        ssize_t for lseek, read.
2019-01-20   David Anderson
      * dwarf_base_types.h: Remove Dwarf_ufixed and 
        Dwarf_sfixed and all __int32_t and __uint32_t use.
        __uint64_t Dwarf_ufixed64 and __int64_t Dwarf_sfixed64
        have also been removed.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: Remove use of those types here too.
      * dwarf_form.c: Remove references to those types here
        too.
      * dwarf_gdbindex.c, dwarf_gdbindex.h: Replace 
        gdbindex_offset_type headerval[6]
        by char gfs[4][6] (replacing dependence on the  int32
        sorts of types.
      * dwarf_macho_loader.h: Clarified that the uint32_t sorts
        of things are just comments.
      * libdwarf.h.in: Fixed a too-long comment line.
      * libdwarfdefs.h: Removed all the *UINT32* and
        *uint64* use.
      * pro_forms.c,pro_opaque, pro_section.c: 
        Removed all the Dwarf_sfixed and ufixed
        stuff here too.
2019-01-14   David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame.c: Add support for DW_CFA_MIPS_advance_loc8
       (though pointless, really) so we can test all the code
       paths of advance_loc production. 
     * dwarf_frame2.c: Minor formatting cleanup.
     * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Now tests for
       negative line numbers in the table and returns an error
       with the new error code DW_DLE_LINE_TABLE_LINENO_ERROR
       (which indicates a corrupted line table).
     * dwarf_names.c, dwarf_names.h, dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated. Just an update of
       the sourcedate comment.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Delete a trailing whitespace character.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Add error DW_DLE_LINE_TABLE_LINENO_ERROR.
     * pro_expr.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     * pro_frame.c( dwarf_add_fde_inst_a): A new simpler 
       more portable implementation of the DW_CFA_advance_loc
       code.
     * pro_opaque.h: Delete blank last line.
2019-01-12   David Anderson
     * dwarf_abbrev.c,dwarf_abbrev.h,dwarf_base_types.h,
       dwarf_die_deliv.c, dwarf_dsc.c,dwarf_error.c,
       dwarf_error.h,dwarf_form.c,dwarf_frame.c,
       dwarf_frame.h,dwarf_frame2.c,dwarf_global.h,
       dwarf_leb.c,dwarf_line.c,dwarf_line.h,
       dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h,dwarf_loc.c,
       dwarf_loc2.h,dwarf_macro5.c,dwarf_macro5.h,dwarf_opaque.h,
       dwarf_print_lines.c,dwarf_query.c,dwarf_util.c,dwarf_util.h,
       pro_arange.c,pro_error.c,pro_error.h,pro_expr.c,
       pro_forms.c,pro_frame.c,pro_frame.h,pro_line.h,
       pro_opaque.h,pro_reloc_stream.c,pro_section.c,
       pro_types.c: Removed all instances of use of
       Dwarf_Word, Dwarf_Sword, __int32_t (and other such).
       In nearly all cases the use was gratuitous. In a few
       cases some very old code was problematic (dwarf_frame2.c)
       and is fixed.
2019-01-10   David Anderson
     * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.
2019-01-09   David Anderson
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: One of the calls to
       dwarf_object_init_b() was checking the result code
       then doing a statment that will crash the caller unless
       the result code was DW_DLV_OK.
2019-01-05   David Anderson
     * dwarf_generic_init.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_generic_init.c: After closing de_fd,
       set de_owns_fd FALSE as an extra guard.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Ensure the configure
       can set O_BINARY if necessary so open() will use it.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_generic_init.c,dwarf_machoread.c,
       dwarf_opaque.h,dwarf_peread.c: Simplified and unified
       the requirement that dwarf_finish() close the fd
       that dwarf_init_path() opened.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * configure.ac: Version 20190104
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Now records that libdwarf owns
       its fd in the elf case and arranges to close it
       when the Dwarf_Debug is being closed.
       This is the case of dwarf_init_path().
       Hopefully will address Coverity CID 190599.
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Now that struct stat
       is not in use delete the sys/types.h and sys/stat.h
       includes as they are no longer needed.
     * dwarf_generic_init(dwarf_init_path): When libdwarf 
       owns the fd, call _dwarf_elf_record_owned_fd()
       to record that information.
       In the default case (not a known object type)
       we also now close the fd.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Add prototype for 
       _dwarf_elf_record_owned_fd, a new internal function
       so the fd can be closed by libdwarf only when 
       libdwarf owns it.
     * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.

2019-01-03   David Anderson
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Had a pointless call to stat()
       which was noticed by Coverity CID  190601
       as a possible race condition. Deleted the call.
     * dwarf_generic_init(dwarf_init_path):
       Serious bugs introduced yesterday.
       Coverity CID 190600.
       the fd is remembered in the Dwarf_Debug
       being created and will eventually be closed
       when the Dwarf_Debug is closed.
2019-01-02   David Anderson
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c(dwarf_get_real_section_name): 
       Uninitialized local char array
       could lead to unpredictable behavior, so now initialized
       with a NUL first byte so the array is a legal string.
       Coverity CID CID 190598.
     * ChangeLog: Renamed ChangeLog2018. New ChangeLog created.
     * Makefile.am: Added ChangeLog2018 to files in dist.
     * gennames.c(GenerateOneSet): Fixing Coverity CID 190603
       by removing an unused (unusable) value. 
     * dwarf_machoread.c.The include order
       is now libdwarfdefs.h then dwarf_base_types.h
     * dwarf_peread.c: The include order
       is now libdwarfdefs.h then dwarf_base_types.h
       Was leaking memory re-malloc into local var
       localdoas. Coverity CID 190602.
     * dwarf_generic_init.c(dwarf_init_path): 
       We clarify the use of fd and in case
       of failure ensure we close the fd if
       it is open (fd >= 0). 
     * dwarf_object_detector.c(dwarf_object_detector_path):
       Mistaken 'fix'
     * libdwarf_version.h: Updated version string.
