     * dwarfgen.cc,dwarfgen/ireptodbg.cc: Fixing issues
       reported by the llvm scan-build tool. 
2019-01-20 David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc: Remove use of uint32_t and uint64_t
       and use Dwarf_Unsigned for arithmetic.

     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Made a partial step toward
       being able to read eh_frame, but those few lines
       are ignored for now.
     * dwarfgen.cc,general.h: Adding --add-frame-advance-loc option
       which causes testing of the new DW_CFA_advance_loc
       emitting code (better portability of the code).
     * irepframe.h: Changed index results from signed
       to unsigned. Negative values never meant anything.
     * irepresentation.h: Added code for eh_frame.
     * ireptodbg.cc: We now use the improved DW_DLV_OK
       producer calls so we changed away from allowing
       indexes to be negative, we do not need to allow
       that any longer.  Now uses the latest libdwarf
       producer calls for frame data.
       If --add-frame-advance-loc then emit particular
       values of advance_loc to test the code paths
       in the DW_CFA_advance_loc* logic.
       We create a whole new cie/fde pair for  the new
       fde testing output.
