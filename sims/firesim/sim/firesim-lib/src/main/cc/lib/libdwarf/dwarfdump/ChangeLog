       print_aranges.c,print_die.c,print_macro.c,

    * globals.h: Remove the code for *UINT* and
      all the ifdefs involved. No longer needed.
    * print_die.c(get_FLAG_BLOCK_string): Remove 
      the__int32_t from this function (associated with
      DW_AT_SUN_func_offsets).  Simplify the printing
      of these offsets.

    * dwarf_names.c, dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated.
    * print_lines.c: If missing a line number do not
      supply a meaningless -1, supply 0.
      If line table access gets an error, print the error
      and attempt to continue.
    * dwarfdump.c: We try to continue after major errors
      in more places. If any major errors were seen
      a final line of text is reported to standard-out.
