# The default configuration file for use with PCIe cards.
#
# Several variables are used by this configuration file to produce
# various OS configurations.  These can be defined using tile-monitor
# or tile-mkboot's "--hvd" option.  They include:
#
# - XGBE_ARGS: additional options for the xgbe driver, such as
#   "native_driver" to enable Linux networking.  (This would also
#   require defining XARGS to include "TLR_NETWORK=xgbe0" to bring up
#   the interface at boot time.)  This option is only used for the
#   xgbe interface connected to the Ethernet switch on boards with
#   such a switch.
#
# - GBE: if defined, provide drivers for both Gigabit Ethernet ports,
#   and enable the native_driver option on them.  (To bring up an
#   interface at boot time, you'll need to also request that via an
#   XARGS addition, such as "TLR_NETWORK=gbe0".)  This option only
#   applies to boards which support the GbE ports, such as the
#   TILExpress-22G.
#
# - GPIO: if defined, provide Flex I/O drivers that enable Compact
#   Flash (CF) and Solid State Drive (SSD) devices.  This option
#   applies to TILExpress-64 cards with a CF socket, and
#   TILExpress-20G cards with an onboard SSD device.
#
# - STRIPE_MEMORY: if defined, enable striping memory requests across
#   all controllers.  For this to take effect, all controllers must be
#   populated with the same amount of memory.  This option only
#   applies to TILEPro64 processors.
#
# - XARGS: add additional Linux boot arguments.  The /init script
#   takes environment variables to control its behavior; see the
#   System Programmer's Guide for a complete list of these variables,
#   as well as all the Tilera-specific Linux boot flags.
#
#   Some common environment variables are:
#
#   TLR_QUIET=y         Quieten /init during boot (use with "quiet" boot arg).
#   TLR_TELNETD=n       Disable telnetd.
#   TLR_INTERACTIVE=n   Disable interactive shell.
#   TLR_SHEPHERD=n      Disable shepherd.
#   TLR_SHEPHERD_ARGS="xxx"  Specify alternate shepherd arguments.
#
#   Note that the default TLR_SHEPHERD_ARGS cause the shepherd to
#   listen for connections on PCIe channel 0 and TCP port 963, which
#   is probably not appropriate for production use.


# Several variables are extracted from properties in /dev/tilepciN/info,
# including CHIP_VERSION, CHIP_WIDTH, CHIP_HEIGHT, and BOARD_HAS_PLX.
#
# We define shorter variables for the chip height and the chip width,
# and a convenient variable for the Y-coordinate of the bottom row.
# 
# In this file, we restrict the dedicated tiles to the bottom row, so
# that all of the other tiles will be available for user applications.
# The main exception is when the GBE variable is defined; in this case
# we use some tiles in the rightmost column for the GbE drivers.  This
# is not necessarily optimal.  Normally, for example, it is better to
# put xgbe/0 on the top row.
