 Memory Coalescing

 Coalesced memory access allows the FPGA to reduce the number of global memory accesses
 by processing multiple work items at once. This increase in throughput without
 communication/latency cost. If the addresses to the global items are not aligned, 
 or not completely sequential then each work item do a individual global access which 
 result in bad throughput as access to DDR have high latency.

 If thread i is reading from memory location n, then have thread i+1 read from location n+1,
 then these reads are coalesced into one transaction. Merge requests to elements from the
 same memory bank into a single request. This increase local storage and involve pseudo
 vectorization, which might increase control complexity.

 There are instances where this technique will have little to no effect. If the DDR accesses
 are properly pipelined then this memory coalescing technique have no benefit. 
 proper vectorization might actually improve computation/control ratio
