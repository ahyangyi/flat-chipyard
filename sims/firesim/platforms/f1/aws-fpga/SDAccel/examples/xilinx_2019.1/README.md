SDAccel Example Repository
===========================

Welcome to the SDAccel example repository. This repository contains the latest examples to get you started with application optimization targeting Xilinx PCIe FPGA acceleration boards. All examples are ready to be compiled and executed on SDAccel supported boards and accelerated cloud service partners. The repository is organized as follows:

1. PREREQUISITE
2. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
3. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
5. EXECUTION IN CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS
6. SUPPORT


## 1. PREREQUISITE

SDAccel Git Examples Assumes that user is familiar with Basic SDAccel Environment, Setup, Programming and Debugging Flow. If not, it is recommended to cover these topics from [SDAccel User Guides][]:
 - UG1238 - SDAccel Development Environment
 - UG1277 - SDAccel Programming Guide
 - UG1281 - SDAccel Debugging Guide

## 2. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

Board | Software Version
------|-----------------
Xilinx Alveo U200|SDx 2019.1
Xilinx Alveo U250|SDx 2019.1
Xilinx Alveo U280|SDx 2019.1

## 3. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION

It is primarily recommended to start with [Hello World][] example which makes the new users aware about the basic structure of an SDAccel based Application.

### Compiling for Application Emulation
As part of the capabilities available to an application developer, SDAccel includes environments to test the correctness of an application at both a software functional level and a hardware emulated level.

These modes, which are named sw_emu and hw_emu, allow the developer to profile and evaluate the performance of a design before compiling for board execution.
It is recommended that all applications are executed in at least the sw_emu mode before being compiled and executed on an FPGA board.

```
    cd <PATH TO SAMPLE APPLICATION>
    make all TARGET=<sw_emu|hw_emu> DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>
```
where
```
	sw_emu = software emulation
	hw_emu = hardware emulation
```

*NOTE:* The software emulation flow is a functional correctness check only. It does not estimate the performance of the application in hardware.

The hardware emulation flow is a cycle accurate simulation of the hardware generated for the application. As such, it is expected for this simulation to take a long time.
It is recommended that for this example the user skips running hardware emulation or modifies the example to work on a reduced data set.

### Executing Emulated Application 
***Recommended Execution Flow for Example Applications in Emulation*** 

The makefile for the application can directly executed the application with the following command:
```
    cd <PATH TO SAMPLE APPLICATION>
    make check TARGET=<sw_emu|hw_emu> DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>

```
where
```
	sw_emu = software emulation
	hw_emu = hardware emulation
```
If the application has not been previously compiled, the check makefile rule will compile and execute the application in the emulation mode selected by the user.

### Compiling for Application Execution in the FPGA Accelerator Card
The command to compile the application for execution on the FPGA acceleration board is
```
    cd <PATH TO SAMPLE APPLICATION>
    make all DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>
```
The default target for the makefile is to compile for hardware. Therefore, setting the TARGETS option is not required.
*NOTE:* Compilation for application execution in hardware generates custom logic to implement the functionality of the kernels in an application.
It is typical for hardware compile times to range from 30 minutes to a couple of hours.

## 4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

- ### GETTING STARTED
Collection of examples geared at teaching the user best practices in how to use different features of SDAccel and start on their own application.

- ### ACCELERATION
Collection of examples in processor offloading to FPGA based compute units.

- ### VISION
Collection of examples in image and video processing. 

- ### LIBS
Collection of common libraries used across all examples to assist in the quick development of application host code. 

- ### UTILITY
Collection of utility functions used as part of the Makefiles in all of the examples. This set includes Makefile rules and scripts to launch SDAccel compiled applications onto boards hosted by Nimbix directly from the developers terminal shell.

## 5. Execution in Cloud Environments

FPGA acceleration boards have been deployed to the cloud. For information on how to execute the example within a specific cloud, take a look at the following guides.
* [AWS F1 Application Execution on Xilinx Devices]
* [Nimbix Application Execution on Xilinx Devices]
