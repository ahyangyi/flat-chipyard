/*******************************************************************************

SDx Key Concept :
    
    This is a vector addition based example which showcases the effectiveness of
    using heavier single compute unit instead of multiple compute units to achieve 
    similar performance.    

*******************************************************************************/

/*

Kernel Description (Good Example) :
   
    This example uses array partition and unrolling (automatic) to showcase higher
    parallelism with a single compute unit and achieves similar performance compared
    to naive implementation which uses multiple compute units to achieve better 
    performance. 
    
    Note : Naive version (Bad Example) version is in the file vadd_bad.cpp
    
    Arguments :
    
        int *in1   (input ) --> Input Vector - 1
        int *in2   (input ) --> Input Vector - 2
        int *out   (output) --> Output Vector
        int  size  (input ) --> Size of Vector

    Kernel Configuration :
        
        1. Vector Size  = 81920
        2. Work Groups  = 8
        3. Work Items   = 8     ( One per each Work_Group )
        4. Local Buffer = 5120  ( Work_Item Load )
