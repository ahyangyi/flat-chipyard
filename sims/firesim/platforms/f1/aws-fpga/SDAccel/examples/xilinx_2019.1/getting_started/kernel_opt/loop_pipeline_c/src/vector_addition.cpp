   Loop Pipelining

   Pipelining is a form of parallelism that allows the FPGA to reuse the
   hardware for the next instruction before the current instruction has finished
   processing. This maximizes the utilization of the FPGA fabric and allows the
   processing of multiple elements of data at the same time.

   The xocc compiler automatically performs this optimization on loops so no
   user intervention is required for most cases. The outer most loops will be
   pipelined and inner loops will be unrolled if possible.

   There are instances where this technique will not yield the best performance.
   For example, if you access two or more global cl_mem objects from within a
   pipelined loop. By default xocc will assign one global memory port to each
   kernel. Because the operations within a pipelined loop are executing in
   parallel different stages of the pipeline will need access to the memory
   port. In order to accommodate this design, xocc will need to serialize the
   access to these ports and therefore increase the initiation interval(II)
   and by extension reduce the throughput.
