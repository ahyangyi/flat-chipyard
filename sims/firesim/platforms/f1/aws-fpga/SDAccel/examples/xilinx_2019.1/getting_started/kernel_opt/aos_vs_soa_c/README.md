Array of Structure(AoS) vs Structure of Arrays(SoA) (C)
======================

This example demonstrates how data layout can impact the performance of certain kernels. The example we will demonstrate how using the Structure of Array data layout can impact certain data parallel problems.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Kernel Optimization, Data Layout

##  DESIGN FILES
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
src/dot_aos.cpp
src/dot_soa.cpp
src/host.cpp
```

##  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./aos_vs_soa <dot XCLBIN>
```
