Description: 
    This Watermark Application example demonstrate to utilized both DDRs and 
    full bandwidth. In Watermark application, kernel has to apply a fixed
    watermark (Here is it Xilinx First Character 'X') into a given Image and 
    write the output image. 
    Inside Host code, input image is placed into Bank0 and Kernel will read
    input Image and write the output image to Bank1.
    To utilized the both Banks fully Kernel is implemented to do burst read 
    input image with full datawidth of 512 and do the burst write of output 
    image with full datawidth of 512. 
    As Kernel is accessing Sequentially from both the DDR, so kernel with get the
    Best memory access bandwidth from both DDRs and will execute with good 
    performance.
