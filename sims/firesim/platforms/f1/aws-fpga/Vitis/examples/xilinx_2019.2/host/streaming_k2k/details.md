Streaming Kernel to Kernel
=============================================================
This example demonstrates how two kernels `kernel_stream_vadd` and `kernel_stream_vmult` can communicate through a stream interface.
Rather than loading the results from producer kernel `kernel_stream_vadd` to global memory and then to consumer kernel `kernel_stream_vmult` we can use stream to transfer this data directly. It reduces the latency of the application and also reduces the memory utilization.

For kernel to kernel streaming transfer, kernel to kernel data transfer ports do not need `clSetKernelArg` from host code.

Producer kernel `krnl_stream_vadd` streaming output port needs to be connected to consumer kernel `krnl_stream_vmult` stream input port during `v++`  using `krnl_stream_vadd_vmult.ini` file as below:  

```
[connectivity]
stream_connect=krnl_stream_vadd_1.output:krnl_stream_vmult_1.b
```
This stream connection specify that `output` streaming port of `krnl_stream_vadd_1` will be connected to `b` streaming port of `krnl_stream_vmult` during system linker run. This connectivity file is provided to v++ command as below:
```
 --config krnl_stream_vadd_vmult.ini
```
