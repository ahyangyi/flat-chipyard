// control interface must also be associated with "return".
// All the global memory access arguments must be associated to one m_axi(AXI Master Interface). Here all three arguments(in1, in2, out_r) are
// associated to bundle gmem which means that a AXI master interface named "gmem" will be created in Kernel and all these variables will be
// accessing global memory through this interface.
// Multiple interfaces can also be created based on the requirements. For example when multiple memory accessing arguments need access to
// global memory simultaneously, user can create multiple master interfaces and can connect to different arguments.
