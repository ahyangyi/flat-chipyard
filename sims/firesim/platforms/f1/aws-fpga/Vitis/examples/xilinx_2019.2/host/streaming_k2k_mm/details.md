Streaming Kernel to Kernel Memory Mapped
==============================================================

This example demonstrates how kernels can have memory mapped inputs along with stream interface from one kernel to another.

`kernel_stream_vadd` has two memory mapped inputs and one stream output. `kernel_stream_vmult` has one memory mapped input along with kernel to kernel stream from `kernel_stream_vadd` which acts as its second input.

Kernel arguments are not required to be setup in host code for kernel to kernel streaming interfaces. Argument 2 for `kernel_vadd` and argument 1 for `kernel_vmult` are not declared.  

```c++
err = krnl_vadd.setArg(0, buffer_in1);
err = krnl_vadd.setArg(1, buffer_in2);
err = krnl_vadd.setArg(3, size));
err = krnl_vmult.setArg(0, buffer_in3));
err = krnl_vmult.setArg(2, buffer_output));
err = krnl_vmult.setArg(3, size));
```
Producer kernel stream output port must be connected to consumer kernel stream input port during the `v++` linking stage.

```
--config krnl_stream_vadd_vmult.ini 
```
Content of `krnl_stream_vadd_vmult.ini` file is below:
```
[connectivity]
stream_connect=krnl_stream_vadd_1.out:krnl_stream_vmult_1.in2 
```
Above specify that `out` port of `krnl_stream_vadd_1` kernel is connected to `in2` port of `krnl_stream_vmult_1`
