Description: 
    HLS Dataflow Example using HLS Stream datatype 
    This is example of vector addition to demonstrate HLS Dataflow Pragma 
    functionality to perform task level parallelism using HLS Stream datatype. HLS 
    dataflow pragma instruct compiler to run sub-task parallel. Sub-task can 
    transfer the data using hls stream. In this Example, a vector addition 
    implementation is divided into three sub-task APIs as below:

    1) read_input(): 
        This API reads the input vector from Global Memory and writes it into 
        HLS Stream 'inStream' using blocking write command.

    2) compute_add(): 
        This API reads the input vector from 'inStream' using blocking read 
        command and increment the value by user specified increment. It writes 
        the results into 'outStream' using blocking write command.

    3) write_result(): 
        This API reads the result vector from 'outStream' using blocking read
        command and write the result into Global Memory Location.

    Data Flow Stream based Adder will be implemented as below:
