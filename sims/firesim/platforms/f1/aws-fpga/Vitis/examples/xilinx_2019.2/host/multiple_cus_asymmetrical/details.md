Multiple Compute Units (Asymmetrical) (C)
=========================================================

This example demonstrates how multiple compute units can do parallel processing where the compute units are asymmetrical i.e. connected to different memory banks.

Kernel can be connected to different banks using vadd.ini file as below:

```
[connectivity]
nk=vadd:4:vadd_1.vadd_2.vadd_3.vadd_4
sp=vadd_1.in1:DDR[0]
sp=vadd_1.in2:DDR[0]
sp=vadd_1.out_r:DDR[0]
sp=vadd_2.in1:DDR[1]
sp=vadd_2.in2:DDR[1]
sp=vadd_2.out_r:DDR[1]
sp=vadd_3.in1:PLRAM[0]
sp=vadd_3.in2:PLRAM[0]
sp=vadd_3.out_r:PLRAM[0]
sp=vadd_4.in1:PLRAM[1]
sp=vadd_4.in2:PLRAM[1]
sp=vadd_4.out_r:PLRAM[1]
```

Some of the vadd compute units are connected to DDR banks and some are connected to PLRAMs.
`nk` option can be used to specify how many compute unit are needed for `vadd` kernel. It also allows to give names of user choice. 
`sp` option can be used to provide connection of compute units to target memory (DDR, PLRAM).

`vadd.ini` file should be included in v++ command line as below:
```
--config vadd.ini 
```

As each compute unit are connected to diferrent DDR/PLRAM, so host program has to create kernel object specific to compute unit as below:
```c++
cl::Kernel cu0_krnls = cl::Kernel(program, "vadd:{vadd_1}");

```
The kernel object which is created above is very specific to `vadd_1` compute unit. Using this Kernel Object, host can directly access to this fix compute unit.
