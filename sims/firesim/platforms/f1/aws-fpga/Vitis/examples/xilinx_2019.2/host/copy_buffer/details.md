Copy Buffer
============
This example illustrates the use of `clEnqueueCopyBuffer` API which is used to copy the contents of a buffer into another buffer in the global memory without copying the contents to host and back.

Contents of `buffer_a` are copied into `buffer_b`.

```c++
err = q.enqueueCopyBuffer(buffer_a, buffer_b, 0, 0, size_in_bytes);
```

Note: Only CDMA enabled platforms will copy the buffer directly using `clEnqueueCopyBuffer` API. Please check platform Info to make sure if platform is CDMA enabled or not.
