Device Only Buffer (C)
======================

This example will demonstrate how to create buffers in global memory which are not mapped to host.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Device only buffer

***KEYWORDS:*** CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS

##  DESIGN FILES
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
src/host.cpp
src/madd.cpp
src/mmult.cpp
```

##  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./device_only_buf <device_only_buf XCLBIN>
```
