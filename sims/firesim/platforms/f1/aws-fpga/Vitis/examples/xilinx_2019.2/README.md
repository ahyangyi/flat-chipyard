Vitis Accel Examples' Repository
================================

Welcome to the Vitis Accel Examples' repository. This repository contains examples to showcase various features of the Vitis tools and platforms. It is expected that users have gone through the tutorials and have developed a basic understanding of the tools and the programming model. This repository illustrates specific scenarios related to host code and kernel programming  through small working examples. The intention is for users to be able to use these working examples as a reference while developing their own accelerator application based on Xilinx platforms.
