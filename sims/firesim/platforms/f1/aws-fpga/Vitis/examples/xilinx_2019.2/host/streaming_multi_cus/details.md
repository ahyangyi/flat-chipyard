Stream Multiple Compute Units
==========================================
This is a simple vadd Kernel design in which multiple compute units of kernel are directly communicating with host using stream interfaces.

For this examples, four compute units of a kernel is created. 
`krnl_stream_vadd.ini` file specifies number of compute units along with name of each compute unit as below:
```
[connectivity]
nk=krnl_stream_vadd:4:vadd_1.vadd_2.vadd_3.vadd_4
```

This file is included to v++ command line using following statement:
```
--config krnl_stream_vadd.ini 
```

Host is written configurable for number of compute units using top level const variable `NCU`:
```
auto constexpr NCU = 4;
```
User just needs to change NCU to some other value to make the host code ready for other numbers. But user still needs to manually update the `krnl_stream_vadd.ini` file for other configuration.

For multiple compute units case, host codes needs to create kernel object using specific compute unit name as below:

```c++
std::string cu_id;
std::string krnl_name = "krnl_stream_vadd";
std::vector<cl::Kernel> krnls(NCU);
for (int i = 0; i < NCU; i++) 
{
    cu_id = std::to_string(i + 1);
    auto krnl_name_full = krnl_name + ":{" + "vadd_" + cu_id + "}"; //kernel name with compute unit name
    krnls[i] = cl::Kernel(program, krnl_name_full.c_str());
}
```
Here compute unit should match to name provided in `krnl_stream_vadd.ini` file.

Once we have unique kernel object for each compute unit, host code can easily creates stream object for respective kernel object and transfer data accordingly.
