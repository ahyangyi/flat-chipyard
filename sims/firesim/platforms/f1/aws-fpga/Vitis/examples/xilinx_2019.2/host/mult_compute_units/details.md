Multiple Compute Units
=======================

This example explains how to create multiple instances of a kernel and execute them concurrently.

For the same kernel to be instantiated into multiple compute units, `nk` flag is used to specify the number of compute units in a `.ini` config file as shown below:

```
[connectivity]
nk=vadd:4
```

For kernels to execute concurrently, command queue is initialized with out of order execution mode enabled.

```c++
OCL_CHECK(err,
              q = cl::CommandQueue(context, device,  CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE |   CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE, &err));
