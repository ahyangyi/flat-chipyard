Loop Dependency Inter
==========================

This example demonstrates how extra information about dependency can be specified for variables in consecutive loop iterations using 
`#pragma HLS DEPENDENCE`. It allows the `V++` to recognize dependencies and optimize the loop executions.

For example here `linebuf` has `false inter dependency` which means each iteration of loop is independent for `linebuf` access.

`#pragma HLS DEPENDENCE` allows compiler to ignore dependency of linebuf and generate a pipeline with lower II count.
If user does not provide this pragma, by default compiler assumes dependency exists on linebuf between iterations.
As a result, compiler schedules unoptimized design with larger II factor which in turn leads to slow performance.
```c++
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable = linebuf dim = 1 complete
VConvH:
    for (int col = 0; col < height; ++col) {
    VConvW:
        for (int row = 0; row < width; ++row) {
           #pragma HLS DEPENDENCE variable=linebuf inter false
           #pragma HLS PIPELINE
            int in_val = inStream.read();
            int out_val = 0;
        VConv:
            for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
                int vwin_val = i < (K - 1) ? linebuf[i][row] : in_val;
                out_val += vwin_val * vcoeff[i];

                if (i > 0)
                    linebuf[i - 1][row] = vwin_val;
            }
            outStream << out_val;
        }
    }
}
```
