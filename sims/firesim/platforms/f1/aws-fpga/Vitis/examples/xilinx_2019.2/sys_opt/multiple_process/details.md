Multiple Process (C)
======================

This example will demonstrate how to run multiple processes to utilize multiple kernels simultaneously on an FPGA device.
Multiple processes can share access to the same device provided each process uses the same xclbin.
Processes share access to all device resources but there is no support for exclusive access to resources by any process.

If two or more processes execute the same kernel, then these processes will
acquire the kernel's compute units and will be
scheduled in a first-come first-serve manner. All processes have the same priority in Xilinx Runtime(XRT) Environment.

__PREREQUISITE__: Host is required to set the environment variable:

```
XCL_MULTIPROCESS_MODE = 1
```

The example comprises of three different kernels for performing vector addition, subtraction and multiplication.
The host uses C provided function `fork()` for invoking different child process for each of the kernel to execute.
The three child processes created can be identified by their process ID using the function `getpid()`. Similarly, if required, parent process ID
can also be achieved using the function `getppid()`.

```c
	 for(int i=0; i< num_of_child_process; i++) {
	     if(fork() == 0) {
	         printf("[CHILD] PID %d from [PARENT] PPID %d",getpid(),getppid());
	         result = run_kernel(krnl_id);
	     }
	 }
```

For each of the process, the following tasks can be viewed along with their PID:
1. Transfer the Input Data to Device
2. Launch Kernel
3. Transfer the Output Data from Device
4. Checking the Output Data with Golden Results

The flow of the above stated tasks will give the users an in-sight information of how multiprocessing is performed by the Xilinx FPGA device.
Until all the child processes are finished, parent process (host) waits for any further execution

__LIMITATION__: In Emulation flow, Debug and Profile will not function correctly when multi-process has been enabled.
