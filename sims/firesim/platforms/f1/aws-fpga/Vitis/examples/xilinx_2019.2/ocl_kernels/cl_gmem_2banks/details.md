Global Memory Two Banks
========================

This example demonstrates how buffers can be created in two different DDR(Global memory) banks.

By default, all the memory interfaces from all the kernels are connected to a single global memory bank.
As a result, only one memory interface at a time can transfer data to and from the memory bank, limiting the performance of the kernel.
If the FPGA contains only one `DDR` (or global) memory bank, this is the only option. However, some FPGA devices contain multiple DDR 
memory banks. You can customize the connections among the kernel memory interfaces and the DDR memory bank of such a device by altering
the default connection.

Banks need to be specified using `--sp` tags in the kernel linking stage along with the `port name` and `kernel name`.

```
--sp apply_watermark_1.input:DDR[0] --sp apply_watermark_1.output:DDR[1]
```
