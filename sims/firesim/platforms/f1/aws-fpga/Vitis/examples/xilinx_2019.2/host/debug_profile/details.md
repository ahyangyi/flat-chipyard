Debug profile
===============

The Vitis development environment can generate a waveform view and launch a live `waveform
viewer` when running hardware emulation. It displays in-depth details on the emulation results at
system level, compute unit level, and at function level. The details include data transfers between
the kernel and global memory, data flow via inter-kernel pipes as well as data flow via intrakernel
pipes. They provide many insights into the performance bottleneck from the system level
down to individual function call to help developers optimize their applications.

Example uses a simple vector addition kernel to demonstrate the debugging information that can be viewed in the waveform.

`xrt.ini` file is used to launch the waveform. Waveform can be viewed at runtime by launching GUI with the following command in this file.
```
[Emulation]
launch_waveform=GUI
```
Waveform can also be generated by using `.wdb` file generated during hardware emulation which can be opened in `Vivado` with the commands written in the script provided under `scripts/open_waveform.tcl`. For this case, we need to add the following flags in the `xrt.ini` file:

```
[Emulation]
launch_waveform=batch
```

Waveforms are helpful to view data transfers to memory from host as well as data transfer from each AXI Master ports. Another feature which waveform viewer provides is the `CU Stalls`. The stall bus compiles all of the lowest level stall signals and reports the percentage that are stalling at any point in time. This provides a factor of how much of the kernel is stalling at any point in the simulation and user can optimize the design to improve the utility of hardware based on these stall signals.
