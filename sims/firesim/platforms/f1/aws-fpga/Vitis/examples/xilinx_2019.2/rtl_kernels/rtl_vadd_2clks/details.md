Vadd 2 Kernel Clocks
=====================================
This example demonstrates the use of `two kernel clocks` for a simple case of vector addition.

An RTL kernel can have up to two external clock interfaces; a primary clock, `ap_clk`, and an
optional secondary clock, `ap_clk_2`. Both clocks can be used for clocking internal logic.
However, all external RTL kernel interfaces must be clocked on the primary clock. Both primary
and secondary clocks support independent automatic frequency scaling.

These clock frequencies are specified at V++ linking stage in the following manner.

```
kernel_frequency=0:150|1:250 
```
