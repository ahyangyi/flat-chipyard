Dataflow Stream Array
=======================

This example demontrates the use of an array of `HLS streams` in kernels.


 Kernel performs a number of vector additions. Initial vector is taken from the global memory and is written into a stream. Operator `<<` is 
 overloaded to perform a `blocking write` to a stream from a variable.
 
```c++
 mem_rd:
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
       #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
       #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=c_size max=c_size
        inStream << input[i];
    }
```

Multiple additions are performed using the `adder` function which take the input from a stream and provide the output to another stream.

```c++
compute_loop:
    for (int i = 0; i < STAGES; i++) {
       #pragma HLS UNROLL
        adder(streamArray[i], streamArray[i + 1], incr, size);
    }
```

Finally, result is written back from stream to global memory buffer.

```c++
static void write_result(int *output, hls::stream<int> &outStream, int size) {
mem_wr:
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
       #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
       #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=c_size max=c_size
        output[i] = outStream.read();
    }
}
```
