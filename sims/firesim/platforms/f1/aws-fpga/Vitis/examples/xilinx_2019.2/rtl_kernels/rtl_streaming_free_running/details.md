Stream Free Running
=======================

This example demonstrates the use of RTL `free running` kernel. Free running kernel starts as soon as it is out of reset and never stops.
Free running kernels can only have `stream interfaces` for communication with the host. Kernel simply increments the input by 1 and returns
the result.

RTL kernels can be integrated to Vitis using `RTL Kernel Wizard`. These kernels have the same software interface model as OpenCL and 
C/C++ kernels. That is, they are seen by the host application as functions with a void return value, scalar arguments and pointer arguments.
For free running kernels, Option `ap_ctrl_none` has to be chosen while setting up the kernel in the wizard.

The RTL Kernel Wizard automates some of the steps that need to be taken to ensure that the RTL IP is packaged into a kernel that can be 
integrated into a system in Vitis environment. A `kernel.xml` file is generated to match the software function prototype and behavior
specified in the wizard.
