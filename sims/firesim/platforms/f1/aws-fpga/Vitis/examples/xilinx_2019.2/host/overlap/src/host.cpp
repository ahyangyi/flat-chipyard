  Overlap Host Code

  There are many applications where all of the data cannot reside in an FPGA.
  For example, the data is too big to fit in an FPGA or the data is being
  streamed from a sensor or the network. In these situations data must be
  transferred to the host memory to the FPGA before the computation can be
  performed.

  Because PCIe is an full-duplex interconnect, you can transfer data to and from
  the FPGA simultaneously. Xilinx FPGAs can also perform computations during
  these data transfers. Performing all three of these operations at the same
  time allows you to keep the FPGA busy and take full advantage of all of the
  hardware on your system.

  In this example, we will demonstrate how to perform this using an out of order
  command queue.

  Many OpenCL commands are asynchronous. This means that whenever you call an
  OpenCL function, the function will return before the operation has completed.
  Asynchronous nature of OpenCL allows you to simultaneously perform tasks on
  the host CPU as well as the FPGA.

  Memory transfer operations are asynchronous when the blocking_read,
  blocking_write parameters are set to CL_FALSE. These operations are behaving
  on host memory so it is important to make sure that the command has completed
  before that memory is used.

  You can make sure an operation has completed by querying events returned by
  these commands. Events are OpenCL objects that track the status of operations.
  Event objects are created by kernel execution commands, read, write, copy
  commands on memory objects or user events created using clCreateUserEvent.

  Events can be used to synchronize operations between the host thread and the
  device or between two operations in the same context. You can also use events
  to time a particular operation if the command queue was created using the
  CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE flag.

  Most enqueuing commands return events by accepting a cl_event pointer as their
  last argument of the call. These events can be queried using the
  clGetEventInfo function to get the status of a particular operation.

  Many functions also accept event lists that can be used to enforce ordering in
  an OpenCL context. These events lists are especially important in the context
  of out of order command queues as they are the only way specify dependency.
  Normal in-order command queues do not need this because dependency is enforced
  in the order the operation was enqueued. See the concurrent execution example
  for additional details on how create an use these types of command queues.
