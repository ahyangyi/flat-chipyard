Global Memory Two Banks
========================

This example demonstrates how buffers can be created in two different DDR(Global memory) banks.

By default, all the memory interfaces from all the kernels are connected to a single global memory bank. As a result, only one memory interface at a time can transfer data to and from the memory bank, limiting the performance of the kernel. If the FPGA contains only one DDR (or global) memory bank, this is the only option. However, some FPGA devices contain multiple DDR memory banks which allows us to customize the connections among the kernel memory interfaces and the DDR memory bank of a device by altering the default connection.

Seperate bundle names need to be specified for each buffer to be placed in different bank.

```c++
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port = input offset = slave bundle = gmem0
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port = output offset = slave bundle = gmem1
```
This example uses watermark application to demonstrate the utilization of multiple DDRs for full bandwidth. Input image is placed into `Bank0` and kernel will read the input Image and write the output image to `Bank1`.
Banks need to be specified using `sp` tags in apply_watermark.ini file along with the port name and kernel name.
```

sp=apply_watermark_1.input:DDR[0]
sp=apply_watermark_1.output:DDR[1]
```
