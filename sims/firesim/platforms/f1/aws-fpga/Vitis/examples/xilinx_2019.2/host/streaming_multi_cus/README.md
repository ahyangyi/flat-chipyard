Stream Multiple Compute Units
======================

This is a simple vadd Kernel design in which multiple compute units of kernel are directly communicating with host using stream interfaces.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Read/Write Stream, Create/Release Stream

***KEYWORDS:*** cl_stream, CL_STREAM_EOT, nk

## EXCLUDED PLATFORMS
Platforms containing following strings in their names are not supported for this example :
```
zc
xdma
xilinx_u250_qep
samsung
```

##  DESIGN FILES
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
src/host.cpp
src/krnl_stream_vadd.cpp
```

##  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./vadd_stream <krnl_stream_vadd XCLBIN>
```
