Wide Memory Read/Write (C)
============================

This example demonstrates the use of `ap_uint<>` datatype which enables `V++` to figure out the memory datawidth for the kernel to global memory transfers.

 For efficient use of this bandwidth, `ap_uint<512>` is used as interface between kernels and global memory allows for maximum 
 of 512 bits to be transferred concurrently. User must include `ap_int.h` to use these datatypes.

 ```c++
#define DATAWIDTH 512
typedef ap_uint<DATAWIDTH> uint512_dt;

uint512_dt v1_local[BUFFER_SIZE];
uint512_dt result_local[BUFFER_SIZE];
```

Using 512 bits user can enable the `burst` read and write for the data by using `#pragma HLS PIPELINE`.

```c++
v1_rd:
       for (int j = 0; j < chunk_size; j++) {
          #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
          #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=c_chunk_sz max=c_chunk_sz
           v1_local[j] = in1[i + j];
       }
```
