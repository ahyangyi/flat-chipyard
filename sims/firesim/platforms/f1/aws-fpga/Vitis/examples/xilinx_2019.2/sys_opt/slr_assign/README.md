SLR Assign (CL)
======================

This is simple example to describe SLR assignment information for a platform design. This example highlights how to provide extra input to assign the logic of the kernel into a nominated SLR. In this example we are assigning first kernel(Vector Multiplication) to SLR0 and assigning the second kernel(Vector Addition) to SLR1

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** SLR Assignments

***KEYWORDS:*** slr

## EXCLUDED PLATFORMS
Platforms containing following strings in their names are not supported for this example :
```
zc
samsung
```

##  DESIGN FILES
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
src/host.cpp
src/kernel.cl
```

##  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./host <vmult_vadd XCLBIN>
```
