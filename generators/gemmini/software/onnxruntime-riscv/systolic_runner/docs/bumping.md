# Bumping to upstream

Since this is forked from the upstream [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) repo, you may want to manually bump the base commit to match upstream. In most cases a simple 

```
git pull https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime master
```

will suffice (I prefer not to do a `--rebase` here since the fork is long-lived and we don't want to erase history of past commits. Plus rebasing is tedious), but there are some subtle points to keep in mind.

* There will inevitably be some merge conflicts (hopefully few). While most of the systolic specific code is isolated in its own folders, there are a few places were we have to modify the core onnxruntime files in order to add providers or otherwise interop. Resolve these as appropriate; you may want to reference the upstream commit id from which the conflict originated to see why the upstream change was made. In some cases (API change) you will have to patch other files to get things to build again.

* Be careful with submodules. Maybe it's just me but git submodule management is horrible and for some reason git pull never actually bumps the submodule commits. Simplest way I found is to just manually compare the submodules (in `cmake/external`) with upstream and bump manually as needed.
 
When you commit your changes after bumping, please do so on a new branch named according to the current date. This provides a way to "version" releases and makes finding regressions caused by upstream changes easier.

Another important note is that sometimes you'll have to edit the build scripts for the imagenetrunner/etc. because they link to a new module. You can get the list of modules to link against by running the main ORT build with `export VERBOSE=1` so that cmake prints out the actual gcc commands. VERY IMPORTANT is that you preserve both the existence and order the wonkier libraries that we link against: the whole `-ldl -static -Wl,--whole-archive -lpthread -latomic -lrt -Wl,--no-whole-archive` stuff. This is needed because we are statically linking the binary and glibc HATES it. So we make it happy with this one weird trick. For more info see the comment in the main ORT `build.sh` file. Without it, the binary will just segfault (in qemu it silently exits).

Note that there is one part of the project which you will need to periodically bump manually, and that is the quantizer (`systolic_runner/quantizer`). The reason why we have copied this out from the original location is two-fold

 * Originally the upstream quantizer did not support int8 well, so we had to make a lot of changes to get it working. So it's not as self-contained as the systolic execution provider stuff.
 * The quantizer has had a lot of code churn (it seems like it's partially rewritten every other month), which would have made rebasing annoying.

 So you will need to monitor it periodically for changes to pull in. Unfortunately because the quantizer is something that's not really tested that often, it's possible to easily break it on some of the more complex networks. (TODO: We should add some tests for this ourself).
