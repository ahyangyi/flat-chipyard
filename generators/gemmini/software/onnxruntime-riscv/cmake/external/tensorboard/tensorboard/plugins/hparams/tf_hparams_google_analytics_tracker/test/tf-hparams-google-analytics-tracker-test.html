<!-- We don't track users in open-source.
     tf-hparams-google-analytics-tracker is an element with no-op methods
     and thus doesn't need tests. We keep this file here instead of deleting
     it entirely, so that we don't need to change the sites where its used
     as well, when syncing the code back to Google's internal repo.
